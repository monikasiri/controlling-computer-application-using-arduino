### **Project Summary**
---
This project allows users to control basic computer functions—such as media playback and volume—using simple hand gestures. It uses an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and a Python program on a laptop. The hand gestures are detected by the sensors, interpreted by the Arduino, and then sent to the laptop, where a Python script simulates keyboard presses to control applications like VLC Media Player.

### **Abstract**
---
The project is based on Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), where hand gestures are used to communicate with the computer. Instead of clicking buttons, hand movements are detected by ultrasonic sensors connected to an Arduino Uno. The Arduino reads these movements and sends signals to a Python program on the computer. The Python program then performs actions like pressing keys to control apps like VLC Media Player.

Ultrasonic sensors detect how far your hand is from them. This information is processed by Arduino and passed to the computer. The computer then understands the command (like “play” or “pause”) and acts on it.

### **Introduction**
---
As technology grows, how we interact with machines becomes more important. People have used hand gestures for communication long before spoken language. This project makes use of that idea. It focuses on recognizing simple hand gestures to control a computer. Tools like cameras, motion detectors, or distance sensors can be used to detect gestures—this project uses distance sensors.

### **Hardware and Software Used**
---
**Hardware:**
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)  
- Laptop with USB connection

**Software:**
- Arduino IDE (for programming the Arduino)  
- Python 2.7  
- PyAutoGUI (Python library to simulate keyboard input)

### **Circuit Layout**
---
The ultrasonic sensors are connected to the Arduino Uno, which is then linked to the laptop through a USB cable. Each ultrasonic sensor has a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter sends out sound waves, which bounce off a hand and are detected by the receiver. By measuring how long it takes for the waves to return, the Arduino calculates the distance of the hand. This distance is converted into specific commands and sent to the laptop.

### **Execution**
---
After the hardware setup and software installation are complete, the Python program is executed on the laptop. It establishes a serial connection with the Arduino to receive data from the ultrasonic sensors. Based on the detected hand gestures, the Python code uses the PyAutoGUI library to simulate keyboard inputs. These virtual keystrokes are used to control functions in VLC Media Player, such as play, pause, and volume adjustments—all through hand movements.

### **Algorithms Used**
---

- The ultrasonic sensors capture the hand gestures and distance.  
- The captured gestures are compared with stored gestures.  
- If a match is found, a specific action is executed by the system.  
- If no match is found, no action is performed.


### **Conclusion**
---
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective way to interact with a computer using hand gestures. It provides an alternative to traditional input methods and can be especially useful in hands-free environments. The use of ultrasonic sensors and Arduino makes the system cost-effective and easy to implement, highlighting the potential of gesture-based human-machine interaction.
